What will happen if you try to compile and run this?
public class Test{
static{
print(10);
}
static void print (int x) {
System.out.println (x);
System.exit(0);
}
}

Output must be one of the following:
a. Compiler error.
b. Will throw a NoSuchMethod error at runtime.
c. It will compile and run printing out "10“
d. It will run with no output.
e. It will run and print "10" and then crash with an error

Answer :
b. Will throw a NoSuchMethod error at runtime.

Assuming that the code is run in Java8.
As Java 8 will not find the main() method to start the program and throw an error saying :
Main method not found in class Test, please define main method.
Before Java8 Static block could be an entry point.
